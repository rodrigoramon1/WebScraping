# WebScraping
WebScraping Python with Selenium- Vulnerability
Description:
The project aims to utilize the Selenium library in conjunction with the Python programming language to automate vulnerability searches on the NVD website. The NVD is a national vulnerability database that provides detailed information about known threats.

Selenium is a widely-used test automation tool that allows interaction with web applications. It enables emulation of user actions in a browser, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating web pages. In this project, we will use Selenium to perform an automated search on the NVD website, fill in the search field, and extract relevant information from the results.

Project Steps:

Environment Setup:

Install Python and Selenium in your development environment.
Ensure that you have ChromeDriver installed and properly configured to work with the Google Chrome browser.
Importing Libraries:

Import the selenium library into your Python script to gain access to its functionalities.
Initialization of Selenium Driver:

Initialize the Selenium driver, specifying the browser to be automated. In this example, we are using ChromeDriver.
Navigation to the NVD website:

Use the driver's get() method to open the NVD website (https://nvd.nist.gov/).
Filling in the search field:

Locate the search field element on the NVD website using the find_element_by_id() method or an appropriate selector.
Utilize the send_keys() method to enter the desired search terms.
Submitting the search form:

Use the submit() method to submit the search form after filling in the search field.
Handling the results:

Utilize Selenium's functions to locate relevant elements in the search results and extract the desired information.
This may include finding links, retrieving text, extracting details for each vulnerability found, among others.
Closing the driver:

After completing the search and extracting the necessary information, close the Selenium driver using the quit() method.
